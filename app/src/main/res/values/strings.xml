    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Sullivan.
    \n\nMy nick name is Sully.
    \n\nI really love my mamas! Their names are Mama-one and Mama-two.
    \nMama-one is my absolute favorite! Shh! Don\'t tell Mama-two. I don\'t want to hurt her feelings.
    \n\nMama-one takes me and my brother, Monkey, outside every morning.
    \nWe love to go outside! We get to smell all the smells, and bark at all the sounds, and look at all the things.
    \nSometimes, we even get to go on hikes with our mamas. Then they let us explore all the new things like, grass and trees and sticks and rocks and all the new critters and animals, and, more smells!!!!
    \nYay!!
    \n\nBut then we always love to come home and eat and sleep afterwards.
    \nBest of all, when mamas are watching the moving pictures, we get to snuggle so close and mamas pet us a long time.
    \nMonkey gets hot sometimes and goes to lay down where he can relax, but not me. I love snuggles!!
    \nMamas are the best! I hope my mamas know how much I love them.
    \nThe End.</string>
